When git format-patch is run at different times or from different base commits, even for identical code changes, the patches can differ in:

Element
Why it changes
Hunk headers (@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@)
Line numbers shift if upstream changed
Context lines
Different surrounding code after rebase
Hunk boundaries
Git may split/merge hunks differently
Function context (@@ ... @@ func name)
Different function nearby
